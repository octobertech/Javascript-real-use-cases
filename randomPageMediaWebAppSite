Came up with and built from scratch using html5, css and js https://hikes.kz (for a travel company) - free mountain hikes web app 
that randomly shows/offers people various hikes on entire page (with photo background) 
when they push the button "I want to go to mountains!". They also can sign up for offered hike via Google forms.

Js code:
<script>
        var sections = document.querySelectorAll("section");
        var randomNum = 0;
        var currentSecId = "";
        function changeSection() {
            var previousNum = randomNum;
            while (randomNum === previousNum) {
                randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * sections.length);
            }
            for (var i = 0; i < sections.length; i++ ) {
                sections[i].style.display = "none";
            };
            sections[randomNum].style.display = "block";
            currentSecId = sections[randomNum].id;
            body.style.backgroundImage = "url('images/" + currentSecId + ".jpg')"
            body.style.backgroundRepeat = "no-repeat"; 
            body.backgroundSize = "cover";
            body.style.backgroundPosition = "center";
            body.style.backgroundAttachment = "fixed";
        };
    </script>
